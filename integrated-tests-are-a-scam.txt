Integrated Tests Are A Scam

Talk: https://vimeo.com/80533536

- an integrated test is any test is where the success or failure depends on many different bits of interesting behavior at once
  - when it fails, I can't point right to the issue that caused it
- not unit tests, isolated tests
- checking vs testing
- isolated tests put tremendous pressure on our design
- if code design has problems, tests will be hard to write
  - 23 lines of test code to check one thing
- more integrated tests, design more sloppily, more bugs == crazy cycle
- combinatorial explosion is far worse than exponential growth
